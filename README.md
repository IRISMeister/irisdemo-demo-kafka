# InterSystems IRIS Data Ingestion and Schema Evolution Example

Demo of InterSystems IRIS with Kafka, Schema Registry, AVRO and Schema Migration

This demo allows you to show:
- A Bank Simulator generating AVRO messages and sending them over Kafka to InterSystems IRIS
- InterSystems IRIS **Multi-model** capabilities (AVRO, JSON, Objects, SQL and MDX)
- How InterSystems IRIS can **transform** the AVRO object into a canonical structure using transformations and **lookups**
- How InterSystems IRIS can **orchestrate** this work and start a **human workflow** in case of a problem during the transformations
- How InterSystems IRIS can provide bidirectional **data lineage** (from source to canonical and vice-versa)
- How InterSytems IRIS pull new schemas from a Kafka Schema Registry and generate the data structures automatically to support **schema evolution**

This demo uses Confluent's Kafka and their docker-compose sample.

## How to run the demo

**WARNING: If you are running on a Mac or Windows, you must give Docker at least 5Gb of RAM for this demo to run properly. Also, please check this [troubleshooting](https://github.com/intersystems-community/irisdemo-base-troubleshooting) document in case you find problems starting the demo with docker-compose. Disk space available for the docker VM is the most common cause for trouble.**

To run the demo on your PC, make sure you have **Git** and **Docker** installed on your machine. 

Clone this repository to your local machine to get the entire source code. Don't worry, you don't need to rebuild the demo from its source. It is just easier this way. After cloning the repo, change to its directory and start the demo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/intersystems-community/irisdemo-demo-kafka
cd irisdemo-demo-kafka
docker-compose up
```

When starting, you will see lots of messages from all the containers that are starting. That is fine. Don't worry!

When it is done, it will just hang there, without returning control to you. That is fine too. Just leave this window open. If you CTRL+C on this window, docker compose will stop all the containers and stop the demo.

After all the containers have started, open a browser at [http://localhost:10001/csp/appint/demo.csp](http://localhost:10001/csp/appint/demo.csp) to see the landing page of the demo. When requested, use the credentials **SuperUser/sys** to log in. 

You are going to see a page like this:

![Architecture of Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intersystems-community/irisdemo-demo-kafka/master/image-iris-datasource/html/landing-page.png)

This is the landing page of the demo. Everything on this image is clickable. The **data simulator** is at the left of the image. Just click on its square to open it. It is capable of generating the **AVRO** messages and send them to Kafka. Here is an example of the UI of the simulator:

![Simulator Running](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intersystems-community/irisdemo-demo-kafka/master/img/simulator_running.png)

After clicking on **Run Test** on the simulator, go back to the demo landing page and click on the green arrow at the right that reads **Normalized Data**. You will see a list of messages that are coming into InterSystems IRIS and being normalized. Click on the **green link of** one of them to see the data lineage (message trace):

## Types of Messages Generated by the Simulator

On this demo, we use a bank data simulator to generate AVRO messages and send them over Kafka to InterSystems IRIS. The simulator is driven by a simple UI. Once you start the docker-compose accordingly to instructions above, you can open the Simulator UI directly by clicking here: [http://localhost:10000](http://localhost:10000) or using the demo landing page as described above.

Here are examples of the AVRO messages sent by the simulator in JSON format so you can see them.

#### corebanking.com.irisdemo.banksim.avroevent.NewCustomerAvroEvent
```JSON
{
    "accountNumber":"0000002",
    "address": 
    { 
        "city":"York",
        "phone":"2989549246",
        "state":"NJ"
    },
    "customerId":3,
    "eventDate":"2020-06-15T00:15:29.904Z",
    "eventId":2,
    "initialAmount":96862.53125,
    "name":"Oswald Newman"
}
```

A message like this can be seen by starting the simulator and then, after waiting for a couple of seconds, you can click here:

http://127.0.0.1:10001/csp/appint/rest/data/corebanking.com.irisdemo.banksim.avroevent.NewCustomerAvroEvent/2


#### corebanking.com.irisdemo.banksim.avroevent.DemographicsAvroEvent

```JSON
{
    "address":
    {
        "city":"New Boston",
        "phone":"5939642280",
        "state":"OR"
    },
    "customerId":43693,
    "eventDate":"2020-06-15T00:15:31.904Z",
    "eventId":50003,
    "name":"Yusef Lopez"
}

```

#### corebanking_com_irisdemo_banksim_avroevent.LoanContractAvroEvent

```JSON
{
    "account":"0036270",
    "amount":4778,
    "contractId":100001,
    "customerId":72539,
    "eventDate":"2020-06-15T00:15:32.904Z",
    "eventId":50004
}
```

#### corebanking_com_irisdemo_banksim_avroevent.TransferAvroEvent

```JSON
{
    "amount":-43294.621410429550451,
    "customerAccount":"0007064",
    "customerId":14127,
    "eventDate":"2020-06-15T00:15:30.904Z",
    "eventId":50001,
    "otherAccount":"0031793",
    "reference":"",
    "transferType":"TRANSFER_OUT"
}
```

## Where is the canonical model

This demo maps two schemas to a single canonical model. The canonical model is comprised of just one class: **Canonical.Customer**. If you click on the gren square at the right on the demo landing page that reads **Canonical Customer** you will be taken to a place where you can run SQL queries like:

```SQL
select * from Canonical.Customer
```

If you run this query before starting the simulator, this table will be empty. If you run it after, the table will show the canonical records.

Here are other queries you can run after you start sending messages to InterSystems IRIS:

#### How many messages have InterSystems IRIS received and what are their status
```SQL
SELECT 
 %ProcessingStatus, count(ID) 
FROM corebanking.AllObjects
group by  %ProcessingStatus 

```

#### Find customers that have many bank transactions

```SQL
select Account->AccountNumber, count(ID) as movements
from Canonical.CheckingAccountMov
group by Account->AccountNumber
order by movements desc
```

#### Find customers that have many bank transactions and has loans

```SQL
select mov.Account->AccountNumber, count(mov.ID) as movements
from Canonical.CheckingAccountMov mov, Canonical.LoanContract loan
where mov.Account->Customer = loan.Customer
group by mov.Account->AccountNumber
order by movements desc
```

#### Get a Customer's checking account balance

```SQL
select cust.FullName, cust.CheckingAccount->AccountNumber, cust.CheckingAccount->OpeningBalance, mov.MovementDate, mov.MovementType, mov.LoanContract, mov.Reference, mov.TransferId, mov.Amount, mov.AccountBalance
from Canonical.CheckingAccountMov mov, Canonical.Customer cust
where mov.Account= cust.CheckingAccount
and mov.Account->AccountNumber= '0022678' 
order by mov.MovementDate
```

## Human Workflow

The work of transforming the original documents to its canonical form is orchestrated by the **Schema Normalization Process**. If the message can not be transformed into the canonical format, the normalization process will start a new **workflow** task so that an application specialist can intervene. 

Until the application specialist intervene, the processing of messages is interrupted in order to guarantee the integrity of the canonical model.

A simple way to cause a problem is to remove a country from the [lookup table](http://localhost:10001/csp/appint/EnsPortal.LookupSettings.zen?LookupTable=US_States_Code_To_Desc.lut) and watch the [workflow inbox](http://localhost:10001/csp/appint/_DeepSee.UserPortal.Workflow.zen) for a ticket to appear. 

You will be able to pick a ticket for yourself. Then you can find the problematic message trace and look at what happend. Then you can add that country back to the lookup table and use the workflow UI to retry processing the message. You will see that, this time, the message will go through. The message trace will show the entire history of the event. This can be stored for many months and years for forensics.

# Other demo applications

There are other IRIS demo applications that touch different subjects such as NLP, ML, Integration with AWS services, Twitter services, performance benchmarks etc. Here are some of them:
* [HTAP Demo](https://github.com/intersystems-community/irisdemo-demo-htap) - Hybrid Transaction-Analytical Processing benchmark. See how fast IRIS can insert and query at the same time. You will notice it is up to 20x faster than AWS Aurora!
* [Twitter Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/intersystems-community/irisdemo-demo-twittersentiment) - Shows how IRIS can be used to consume Tweets in realtime and use its NLP (natural language processing) and business rules capabilities to evaluate the tweet's sentiment and the metadata to make decisions on when to contact someone to offer support.
* [HL7 Appointments and SMS (text messages) application](https://github.com/intersystems-community/irisdemo-demo-appointmentsms) -  Shows how IRIS for Health can be used to parse HL7 appointment messages to send SMS (text messages) appointment reminders to patients. It also shows real time dashboards based on appointments data stored in a normalized data lake.
* [The Readmission Demo](https://github.com/intersystems-community/irisdemo-demo-readmission) - Patient Readmissions are said to be the "Hello World of Machine Learning" in Healthcare. On this demo, we use this problem to show how IRIS can be used to **safely build and operationalize** ML models for real time predictions and how this can be integrated into a random application. This **IRIS for Health** demo seeks to show how a full solution for this problem can be built.
* [Fraud Prevention](https://github.com/intersystems-community/irisdemo-demo-fraudprevention) - Apply Machine Learning and Business Rules to prevent frauds in financial services transactions using InterSystems IRIS.
* [Financial Transactions with Fraud and Rewards/cross-sell](https://github.com/intersystems-community/irisdemo-demo-finsrv-crosssell) - Process credit card transactions while keeping a hot data lake current with data aggregated from your core systems. Use this aggregated data to prevent frauds and verify customer elegibility for for rewards as an example of cross-selling.
